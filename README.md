# Compressor_and_Decompressor
Synopsis of this Project:
1. This is a minor project on compressor and decompressor using Java language
2. The objective is to reduce the number of bits needed to represent data through compression technique
3. The project will only use lossless conversion to ensure no data loss occurs during compression
4. Benefits of compression include saving storage space, speeding up file transfers, and reducing storage hardware and network bandwidth costs
5. Lossless compression is essential to ensure data is not lost while compressing

Below are the overview of my project:

1. UI of the Application

2. Compressing a text document named: "Testfile.docx" of size 18kb

3. Creation of Compressed File with size 15kb

4. Now, decompressing the compressed file of size 15kb

5. A file name DecompressedFile of size same as original file is created

6. Comparison of Original vs Decompressed file
